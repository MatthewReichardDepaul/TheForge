          Week 3 brings two new assignments: cutting something on vinyl, and laser cutting a 3D press-fit kit.
          I have no idea what I'm doing here, so hopefully I will have something that is acceptable by the end of the week.

        In the IRL Lab, we will be using Cricut machines to cut the vinyl sheets, making it a pretty easy process.
        <br><br>
        Update: it was not an easy process...

          I wanted to cut a vinyl sticker to put on my laptop of the 'Aperture Laboratories' company from Portal 2, my favorite video game.
          To the right, you can see the logo. Though it has many small letters, I thought it would be quite simple considering it a simple
          single-color graphic with no depth or shading.

          I uploaded the file into the (awful) Cricut software and, after a few issues, managed to cut the design. I thought I was close to the end.
          How sorely mistaken I was.

          Though the machine had made cuts into the vinyl, I immediately realized something had gone wrong. It was very difficult to 
          remove the un-needed parts of the vinyl (the spare material) and everything was really sticking together. I then used a small hook tool to painstakingly 
          remove the material so that only the logo was left (which took an ungodly amount of time). As it turns out, this is because I had selected my material as 'vinyl'
          (which it was), but not 'premium vinyl' which I guess is a different thickness or something?

          <p style = "text-align:left; font-size:30px;">
          Finally, I got some transfer tape to pick up all of the peices of the logo at once to easily transfer and stick them to my laptop. 
          Right when I thought my troubles were all over, though, everything went wrong. Despite using a roller about 20 times to ensure the peices stuck to the tape,
          they just would not stick, leaving me with tiny letters everywhere and, more importantly, a failure.

          <p style = "text-align:left; font-size:30px;">
          At this point I had to restart and re-cut the log (this time selecting the correct 'premium vinyl' setting).
          I also decided to try a different brand of transfer tape this time, which seemed to pay off because the logo tranferred cleanly 
          and looks great (at least I think so). Finally, success.

        This is a much much more complicated thing than vinyl cutting. We will have to consider things such as the thickness of the material we're working with 
        as well as creating something 2D that, when assembled, will be 3D. Another major part of this assignment, is the design needs to be 'press-fit' to be assembled,
        so no clue or tape or anything.

          Originally, I wanted to make a companion cube from the game 'Portal', but this would be extremely difficult if I wanted to do it properly, so I settled for a simple 
          cube-shaped pen holder. I also wanted to laser-engrave designs into the sides to make things interesting. My first attempt, I just tried to design as I went and it ended up
          in a very 'scuffed' box with weird, improper dimensions and badly designed finger-connectors.

          I prompty got extremely frustrated due to my incompetence, and started over this time following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkpYzOlK5L4">this</a> tutorial
          on YouTube to create the box shape, then I just added a hole to one side to insert the pens into. Despite the fact that I pretty much just stole his design, I learned a lot
          of different ways to save time when designing as well as proper techniques for making cubes. Below you can see my steps in making this version.

          After designing the cube (definitely not 3 more times because its just a cube that would be silly), 
          I made some 'art' for the cube faces in photoshop that would be laser-etched into the wood. The art included random images
          of people such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-dunworth-039117">Chris Dunworth</a>, a cat, my IP address, and others. I imported everything into the software
          and cut the peices with the laser cutter. Below you can see this and a video timelapse of the machine cutting and engraving the wood.

          This project was *supposed* to be 'press-fit' meaning no adhesives, however some of the connections were quite loose.
          I believe this to be due to the fact that the wood board I used was slightly elevated on one side meaning in the areas where it was elevated,
          the laser was slightly less focused. The joints cut away from the elevation worked fine, and the loose ones I glued together. I could have 
          re-cut the cube, but because of the images, the process would take another hour which would just not be worth it. It served its purpose as another
          learning experience.
