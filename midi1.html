          This project is not related to an assignment, but I really wanted to make a drum pad-style midi controller (similar to the MIDIFighter) for me to use. So I did!

          The main design of the controller is from Staal 3D on Thingiverse. The heart of the controller is an Arduino MEGA microcontroller. A grid of 16 arcade/pinball buttons and 4 potentiometers are converted
          to MIDI signals with the code loaded onto the board. I also flashed a custom firmware to the serial/usb chip (a 16U2) so that when plugged into a computer, the device is detected as a midi controller rather
          than an arduino so it can be used right away on any computer. 
          <br>
          For those who don't know, a midi controller is an interface device used to play digital music notes in music production software. They can be piano-style keyboards or drum pads such as this one.

          Starting with some simple tests shorting pins on the controller after getting the software running proved my device would work, so I 3D printed the housing and installed the pots. Soldering them was a very tedious task,
          but they worked perfectly. I'm currently waiting for the arcade buttons to arrive from China, so this is as far as I can get right now. I'll make a new update once I finish it up :)
