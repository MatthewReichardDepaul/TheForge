    <p style="text-align:left; padding-left:15%; padding-right:15%; padding-top:1%; padding-bottom:1%; font-size:30px;">
      I love computers and I've taken some CS courses in high school. I build computers, I take them apart, and I make them do weird things. If you're really, <i>really</i> curious you can 
      see some sites I've made <a class="textbutton" href="https://peenor.neocities.org">here</a>, <a class="textbutton" href="https://aydinmerchant.neocities.org">here</a>, and <a class="textbutton" href="https://thecube.neocities.org">here</a>.
      In high school, an app I made won second place in the 'technology' category in the <a class="textbutton" href="https://d128steam.web.app/">D128 ST3AM showcase</a>. I love playing with all sorts of code when I can, like making android apps, windows software, pure languages like python
      or java, visual scripting, html/css, really anything I can easily mess with.

      Aside from computers, though, I love the arts. Any kind of arts, really. I like to play the drums and write/produce my own music (which can be found by searching 'squidud' on google). I also like to draw and paint as well 
      as take photos of things I find interesting. I thoroughly enjoy walking through art shows and museums and the idea of sharing creations of my own and observing those of others is very appealing to me.

    <h2 class="titletext" style="font-size:45px">Project Ideas</h2>
      <ul style="text-align:left; padding-left:15%; padding-right:15%; padding-top:1%; padding-bottom:1%; font-size:30px;">
        <li><b>Automated Plant Pot</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Receptical for plant</li>
            <li>Uses camera tied to image recognition library to determine plant type</li>
            <li>Plugs plant type into MLM to output information such as watering frequency and light needs</li>
            <li>Waters on a timer (x amount of times per week) and collects light data with a light meter and determines if lighting conditions are ideal after a day</li>
            <li>If the light source is a window, the pot will rotate automatically to even out plant growth</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>All-Day Light-Based MIDI Melody</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Several light sensors that record data at set intervals over a set amount of time</li>
            <li>Performs processes (based on light amount and color) to assign a note to each interval withing a selected key</li>
            <li>Generates a midi sequence that is either stored to an SD card or is played directly through a midi output port</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Planter Table</b>
          <ul>
            <li>A cube-shaped table with a plexiglass top which houses a plant inside</li>
            <li>Utilizing similar technology to the 'Automated Plant Pot' idea</li>
            <li>Plugs plant type into MLM to output information such as watering frequency and light needs</li>
            <li>Waters on a timer (x amount of times per week) and sets glow lights on and off based on plant's needs</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><b>Mood Speaker</b>
          <ul>
            <li>An all-in-one speaker box that plays music to match the mood at the appropriate volume</li>
            <li>Uses light meter to determine the intensity and colors of the light in the room to determine 'mood'</li>
            <li>Connects to music streaming service and plays music based on the 'mood'</li>
            <li>Uses a microphone to determing the volume of the background noise in the room and sets speaker volume to just over that level</li>
            <li>Mood lights on the speaker also change and adapt to the light in the room</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>
